In this lab I created my first Node.js server-side JavaScript file. I installed Prettier, git and Postman. I also learned how to use the termainal to navigate directories, and run a JS file using node.js.

Here is the code from this lab.
```markdown
/*
 CIT 281 Lab 1
 Name: Thomas Guthrie
*/
function square(num) {
    return num*num;
}
console.log('Square operations:')
for (let i = 2; i <= 10; i+=2) {
 console.log(`Square of ${i} is ${square(i)}`);
}
```
